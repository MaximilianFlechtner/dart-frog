# Introduction


Dart Frog is an experimental project under development and should not be used in production at this time.



## Goals ðŸŽ¯

Dart Frog is built on top of [shelf](https://pub.dev/packages/shelf) and [mason](https://pub.dev/packages/mason) and is inspired by many tools including [remix.run](https://remix.run), [next.js](https://nextjs.org), and [express.js](https://expressjs.com).

The goal of Dart Frog is to help developers effectively build backends in Dart. Currently, Dart Frog is focused on optimizing the process of building backends which aggregate, compose, and normalize data from multiple sources. Dart Frog provides a simple core with a small API surface area in order to reduce the learning curve and ramp-up time for developers. In addition, Dart Frog is intended to help Flutter/Dart developers maximize their productivity by having a unified tech stack that enables sharing tooling, models, and more!
